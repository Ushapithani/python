expand window size i+Sliding window problems are a favorite in coding interviews because they test your ability to optimize brute-force solutions. Hereâ€™s a curated list of **top sliding window questions** that frequently show up:

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy Level
- **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**
- **First Negative Integer in Every Window of Size K**
- **Check if a Permutation of a Pattern Exists in a String**
- **Count Occurrences of Anagrams**
- **Smallest Window Containing 0, 1, and 2**

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Level
- **Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters**
- **Subarrays with Product Less Than K**
- **Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length**
- **Fruit Into Baskets**
- **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**

### ðŸ”´ Hard Level
- **Sliding Window Maximum**
- **Minimum Window Substring**
- **Substring with Concatenation of All Words**
- **Longest Substring with K Unique Characters**
- **Count Subarrays with K Different Integers**
